Async Race - Radio-Controlled Car Racing SPA
üìú Project Description
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to manage a collection of radio-controlled cars, operate their engines, and showcase race statistics. 
The application allows users to engage in drag-racing competitions, managing and racing cars via a user-friendly interface.

The project was inspired by a challenge to recreate a nearly-completed application after the original developer lost their work. With the demo video and a server mock as references, 
this application has been meticulously reconstructed with a focus on speed, efficiency, and modular architecture. The goal was to outpace competitors by delivering an innovative solution to car management and racing competitions.

üéØ Objectives
Create a Single Page Application (SPA): Manage a collection of cars, operate their engines, and showcase race statistics in an engaging, interactive SPA.
Revive the Project: Reconstruct the UI from a demo video and server mock, bringing the ambitious project back to life.
Outpace the Competition: Implement the project with speed and efficiency to ensure a timely launch, showcasing our innovative solution.
üöó Functional Requirements
Garage View
CRUD Operations: Manage cars with "name" and "color" attributes.
Color Selection: Choose car colors from an RGB palette with a real-time preview.
Pagination: Display up to 7 cars per page with a feature to generate 100 random cars at once.
Car Animation: Start/stop engine buttons with animations and handling of engine states.
Adaptive Animations: Ensure animations work seamlessly on screens as small as 500px.
Race Animation: Start a race for all cars on the current page with reset functionality and display of the winner's name.
Winners View
Display Winning Cars: Show cars with their image, name, number of wins, and best time.
Sorting and Pagination: Sort winners by wins and best times with pagination support.
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
Pure TypeScript: No libraries or frameworks used, with a focus on strong typing and modular architecture.
SPA Implementation: Content is generated via TypeScript, bundled using Webpack.
Code Quality: Adherence to Airbnb's ESLint configuration, with a focus on clean, maintainable code.
üöÄ Running the Project
To experience the application, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Retrieve the project from the GitHub repository.
Install Dependencies: Ensure Node.js is installed, then install the necessary packages.
Launch the Server: The application uses a server mock to manage car data and race operations. Start the server by following the instructions provided in the [server repository](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).
Start the Application: Once the server is running, start the development server and open your browser to interact with the application.
Enjoy!
